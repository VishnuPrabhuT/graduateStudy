Entire theme of the game would be surrounded around a character played by a Protagonist, who would try to evade and destroy the antagonist to reach a certain goal to complete the game.  \r\n\r\n### Game Logic\r\nI look forward to delve into game development features like Waypoint, Navmesh spatial position triggering along with trying Pathfinding technologies for enemy scripting. Although, I haven't tried AI scripts in any games yet, this project could be a first in trying out new process of game development.\r\n\r\n### Level Design\r\nNeeds to be sketched thoroughly. Would be updating this space regularly.\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n### Assignments \r\n  1.
