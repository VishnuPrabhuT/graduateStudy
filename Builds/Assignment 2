Work done:

Following the work done in the lectures and tutorial video the wall barrier and the paddle for the game was setup!

The Game Manager Script mentioned in the tutorial is the essential element of the entire game. While writing that script i understood how important it is to keep the game flow attached to main camera and then control all the entities of the game accordingly.

1.I also followed the space shooter tutorial to implement shooting for the paddle

2. I used a quad to make a background to resemble space environment and kept all the wall barriers hidden out of the frame of the scene.

3. Kept a particle system flowing with the background to give an impression of flowing space.

Difficulities:

The ball takes straight line trajectories making the game boring. I tried rotating the left and the top wall by few degrees. However, it did'nt result to substantial effect.
