Assignment question: Create a “game”, in which you can move an object in 2D or on a plane with the arrow keys (pick one). 
  Pressing the “f” key moves the camera so that we can see the object.
  Clicking the left mouse button changes the color of the object.
  
  
My attempt was to make the game in 2D perspective with 3D objects. Hence, I rotated the camera in the Y-axis, hecne the player could be able 
to play by looking down and play in xy-axis.

I used Input.getAxis to manipulate the ball's position from the keyboard. For translation of camera objecct based on the position of the ball
was implmented using the transform.position function of the ball gameobject.

Random function along with Math.lerp function was used to change the color of the shader everytime left mouse click was pressed.


Difficulties: I encountered some problem while linking the unity webplayer link via github. Hence, i had to host the resources and index.html 
file on the google drive and then redirect that link on my github webpages.
